During each class, the instructors conducted a handful of exercises designed to foster student discussion. The insights gleaned from these discussions formed the basis for the out-of-class student projects. Displayed here are samples of two classes, complete with descriptions of the class exercises, examples of students' work, and students commentary on the exercises.

Based on their experiences in running the class, the instructors have also compiled guidelines for running interactive seminars of this type. ({{% resource_link 5ed15893-ebe7-7e5a-94ed-8bea7c0b049a "PDF" %}})
